### Hi there 👋

I am Manuel David Soto, just David for friends.

I and exploration geologist and petrophysycist, with more than 20 years of work experience. My interests range from interpretation of open-hole logs, logs to rock quality relation, shale plays, ... Programming, first with Matlab and now with Python (still learning 🌱), has become a passion, whether if it is for teaching or for petrophysic, geology or other technical area. Some examples are just shown here.

For any question you can write me at mdsg66@gmail.com 📫 

Regards

David
