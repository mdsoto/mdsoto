### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Manuel David Soto, just David for friends.

I am an exploration geologist and petrophysycist with over 20 years of work experience. My interests range from the interpretation of open-hole logs, logs to rock quality relation, shale plays, ... Programming, first with Matlab and now with Python (still learning ðŸŒ±), has become a passion, whether it is for teaching or for petrophysic, geology or other technical areas. Some examples are just shown here.

For any question, you can write me at mdsg66@gmail.com ðŸ“« 

Regards

M. David Soto
